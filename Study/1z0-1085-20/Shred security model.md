## Memo

The shared security model in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a collaborative approach to security that benefits both Oracle and its customers.

Oracle is responsible for the security of the underlying OCI infrastructure, including:

- Physical security of data center facilities
- Security of network infrastructure
- Security of virtualization layer
- Security of OCI services

Customers are responsible for the security of their own data and applications in OCI, including:

- Encrypting data at rest and in transit
- Managing access control to data and applications
- Monitoring data and applications for suspicious activity

Some examples of customer responsibilities in OCI include:

- Configuring security settings for OCI resources
- Installing and maintaining security patches for operating systems and applications
- Implementing security policies and procedures for OCI users

By working together under the shared security model, Oracle and its customers can create a more secure cloud environment for everyone.

Here are some of the benefits of the shared security model in OCI:

- **Reduced risk:** The shared security model helps to reduce the risk of security breaches by dividing the responsibility of security between Oracle and its customers. This means that each party is focused on their own area of expertise, which can help to improve the overall security of the OCI environment.
- **Improved compliance:** The shared security model can help customers to comply with industry regulations and standards. By using OCI, customers can be confident that their data is being protected in accordance with best practices.
- **Cost savings:** The shared security model can help customers to save money on security costs. By outsourcing some of their security responsibilities to Oracle, customers can avoid the need to invest in their own security infrastructure and personnel.

Overall, the shared security model in OCI is a valuable framework for securing cloud environments. By working together, Oracle and its customers can create a more secure cloud environment for everyone.

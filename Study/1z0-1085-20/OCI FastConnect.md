## Memo


OCI FastConnect is a dedicated, private network connection between your on-premises data center and OCI. It provides high bandwidth and low latency, making it ideal for applications that require real-time performance, such as gaming, video streaming, and financial trading.

IPSec VPN, public internet, and Virtual Cloud Network Remote Peering are not as reliable or secure as OCI FastConnect, and they may have higher latency.

**Here is a comparison of the four options:**

|Option|Description|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|---|
|OCI FastConnect|Dedicated, private network connection between your on-premises data center and OCI|High bandwidth, low latency, secure|More expensive than other options|
|IPSec VPN|Secure tunnel over the public internet|Less expensive than OCI FastConnect|Lower bandwidth, higher latency, less reliable|
|Public internet|Publicly accessible network|Least expensive option|Lowest bandwidth, highest latency, least reliable|
|Virtual Cloud Network Remote Peering|Peering connection between two Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs)|Can be used to connect two VCNs that are in different regions or different accounts|Lower bandwidth than OCI FastConnect, may have higher latency|

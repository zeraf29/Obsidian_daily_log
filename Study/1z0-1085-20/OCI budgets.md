Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Budgets is a service that allows you to set and track budgets for your OCI resources. Budgets can be set on a monthly or annual basis, and they can be used to track the cost of individual resources or groups of resources.

OCI Budgets can help you to:

- **Control your OCI costs:** By setting budgets, you can track your spending and identify areas where you can save money.
- **Prevent overspending:** OCI Budgets can send you alerts when you are approaching or exceeding your budget. This can help you to take action to prevent overspending.
- **Optimize your OCI usage:** By tracking your OCI usage, you can identify resources that are not being used efficiently. This can help you to optimize your OCI usage and save money.

To use OCI Budgets, you first need to create a budget. You can create a budget for a specific resource or for a group of resources. You can also set a monthly or annual budget limit.

Once you have created a budget, you can track your spending against the budget. OCI Budgets provides a variety of reports that show you your spending over time. You can also set up alerts to notify you when you are approaching or exceeding your budget.

OCI Budgets is a powerful tool that can help you to control your OCI costs, prevent overspending, and optimize your OCI usage.

Here are some examples of how you can use OCI Budgets:

- You can create a budget for your OCI Compute instances to track and control your spending on compute.
- You can create a budget for your OCI Block Volumes to track and control your spending on storage.
- You can create a budget for your OCI Object Storage to track and control your spending on object storage.
- You can create a budget for your OCI Networking resources to track and control your spending on networking.

You can also create budgets for groups of resources, such as all of the resources in a specific compartment or all of the resources used by a specific application.

OCI Budgets is a flexible and powerful tool that can help you to manage your OCI costs.




OCI Budgets can be set on **compartments** and **cost-tracking tags**.

**Compartments** are a logical grouping of resources in OCI. You can use compartments to organize your resources and to manage access to your resources.

**Cost-tracking tags** are custom tags that you can apply to your resources to track your spending.

Tenancy, free-form tags, and Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) are not valid options for setting OCI Budgets.

Here is a table of the five options and whether or not they can be used to set OCI Budgets:

|Option|Can be used to set OCI Budgets?|
|---|---|
|Compartments|Yes|
|Free-form tags|No|
|Tenancy|No|
|Cost-tracking tags|Yes|

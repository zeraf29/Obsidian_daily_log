## Memo

Local NVMe data in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is data that is stored on local NVMe drives that are attached to compute instances. NVMe drives are a type of solid-state drive (SSD) that offer very high performance. They are typically used for applications that require fast access to data, such as databases, real-time analytics, and machine learning.

To use local NVMe data in OCI, you must first attach a local NVMe drive to a compute instance. Once the drive is attached, you can store data on it and access it like any other disk drive.

Local NVMe data is persistent, meaning that it is not lost when the compute instance is restarted. However, it is important to note that local NVMe data is not protected by OCI's built-in backup and recovery services. You must take your own steps to back up and recover local NVMe data.

Here are some of the benefits of using local NVMe data in OCI:

- Very high performance: Local NVMe drives offer very high performance, making them ideal for applications that require fast access to data.
- Low latency: Local NVMe drives have very low latency, meaning that there is very little delay between when data is requested and when it is delivered.
- Scalability: You can attach multiple local NVMe drives to a compute instance to scale the performance and capacity of your storage.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using local NVMe data in OCI:

- Higher cost: Local NVMe drives are more expensive than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs).
- Not protected by OCI's built-in backup and recovery services: You must take your own steps to back up and recover local NVMe data.
- Not suitable for all applications: Local NVMe data is not suitable for all applications, such as those that require high availability or data durability.

Overall, local NVMe data in OCI is a good option for applications that require very high performance and low latency. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether or not to use local NVMe data for your application.

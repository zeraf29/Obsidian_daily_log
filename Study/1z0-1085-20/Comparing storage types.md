## Memo

**File system**

A file system is a data structure that organizes files and folders on a storage device. It provides a way to store and access files in a logical and efficient manner. File systems are used in all types of computing devices, from personal computers to servers to cloud computing platforms.

**Object storage**

Object storage is a type of data storage that stores data as objects. Objects are self-contained units of data that include the data itself, metadata about the data, and a unique identifier. Object storage is a highly scalable and cost-effective way to store large amounts of data.

**Block storage**

Block storage is a type of data storage that stores data as blocks. Blocks are fixed-sized units of data that are typically 4KB or 8KB in size. Block storage is a good choice for storing data that needs to be accessed frequently, such as database files and operating systems.

**Comparison of file system, object storage, and block storage**

The following table compares file system, object storage, and block storage:

|Feature|File system|Object storage|Block storage|
|---|---|---|---|
|Storage type|Hierarchical|Object|Block|
|Use cases|Storing and accessing files and folders|Storing and accessing large amounts of data|Storing and accessing data that needs to be accessed frequently|
|Performance|High|Good|High|
|Scalability|Good|Very high|Very high|
|Cost|Low to medium|Low to medium|Highest|

**Example use cases:**

- **File system:** Storing and accessing user home directories, shared workspaces, and application data.
- **Object storage:** Storing and accessing backups, archives, and web content.
- **Block storage:** Storing and accessing database files, operating systems, and application data.

**Which one should you use?**

The best storage type for you will depend on your specific needs. Consider the following factors when choosing a storage type:

- **Type of data:** What type of data do you need to store? If you need to store file-based data, then a file system is a good choice. If you need to store large amounts of data, such as backups, archives, or web content, then object storage is a good choice. If you need to store data that needs to be accessed frequently, such as database files, operating systems, or application data, then block storage is a good choice.
- **Performance requirements:** How important is performance to you? If you need high performance, then block storage is the best choice. If you can sacrifice some performance for lower cost, then object storage may be a good option.
- **Scalability requirements:** How scalable do you need your storage to be? All of the storage types are scalable, but object storage is the most scalable option.
- **Budget:** How much are you willing to spend on storage? Object storage is the most cost-effective option, followed by a file system and block storage.

## Memo


A secret in Microsoft Azure Functions is a piece of sensitive information, such as a password, API key, or database connection string. Secrets are stored securely in Azure Key Vault, a managed service that provides centralized secrets management and key rotation.

Azure Functions apps can access secrets from Azure Key Vault using Key Vault references. Key Vault references are a secure way to store secret values in your function app's configuration settings without exposing them to your code or in plain text.

To use a Key Vault reference in your Azure Functions app, you need to:

1. Create a secret in Azure Key Vault.
2. Grant your function app access to the secret.
3. Add a Key Vault reference to your function app's configuration settings.

When your function app runs, it will automatically retrieve the secret value from Azure Key Vault and inject it into your code.

There are several benefits to using secrets in Azure Functions:

- **Security:** Secrets are stored securely in Azure Key Vault, which is a managed service that provides centralized secrets management and key rotation.
- **Ease of management:** You can easily add, delete, and update secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- **Scalability:** Azure Key Vault can scale to meet the needs of even the largest enterprises.

Here are some examples of secrets that you might store in Azure Key Vault for your Azure Functions apps:

- Database connection strings
- API keys
- Passwords
- Certificates
- Encryption keys

By storing your secrets in Azure Key Vault, you can help to protect your Azure Functions apps from unauthorized access and data breaches.

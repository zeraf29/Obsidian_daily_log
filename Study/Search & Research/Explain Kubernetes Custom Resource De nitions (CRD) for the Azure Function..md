## Memo

Azure Functions has the following CRDs:

- **Secret:** This CRD allows you to store and manage secrets for your Azure Functions.
- **Deployment:** This CRD allows you to deploy and manage Azure Functions in Kubernetes.
- **ScaledObject:** This CRD allows you to scale Azure Functions based on metrics such as CPU usage or HTTP requests.
- **TriggerAuthentication:** This CRD allows you to authenticate Azure Functions triggers to external resources such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs.

**Secret**

The `Secret` CRD allows you to store and manage secrets for your Azure Functions. This can be useful for storing sensitive information such as connection strings or API keys.

To use the `Secret` CRD, you first need to create a secret object. This can be done using the `kubectl create secret` command. Once you have created the secret object, you can reference it in your Azure Function code using the `secrets.get()` function.

For example, the following Azure Function code would read a secret named `my-secret` from the Kubernetes cluster:

Python

```
import secrets

def my_function(context: Any, event: Any) -> Any:
  secret_value = secrets.get("my-secret")

  # Do something with the secret value

```

**Deployment**

The `Deployment` CRD allows you to deploy and manage Azure Functions in Kubernetes. This can be useful for deploying and managing multiple Azure Functions at once, or for using Kubernetes features such as rolling updates and self-healing.

To use the `Deployment` CRD, you first need to create a deployment object. This can be done using the `kubectl create deployment` command. Once you have created the deployment object, Kubernetes will deploy and manage the Azure Functions according to the object's specification.

For example, the following deployment object would deploy an Azure Function named `my-function`:

YAML

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-function
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-function
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-function
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-function
        image: azurefunctions/dotnet6
        env:
        - name: STORAGE_ACCOUNT
          value: my-storage-account
        - name: CODE_URL
          value: https://my-storage-account.blob.core.windows.net/my-function-code.zip
```

**ScaledObject**

The `ScaledObject` CRD allows you to scale Azure Functions based on metrics such as CPU usage or HTTP requests. This can be useful for ensuring that your Azure Functions are always able to handle the current load.

To use the `ScaledObject` CRD, you first need to create a scaled object object. This can be done using the `kubectl create scaledobject` command. Once you have created the scaled object object, Kubernetes will scale the Azure Functions according to the object's specification.

For example, the following scaled object object would scale the Azure Function named `my-function` to 10 replicas when the CPU usage exceeds 50%:

YAML

```
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: my-function
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-function
  triggers:
  - type: cpu
    metadata:
      name: cpu-trigger
    spec:
      threshold: 50%
      upperThreshold: 75%
      lowerThreshold: 25%
```

**TriggerAuthentication**

The `TriggerAuthentication` CRD allows you to authenticate Azure Functions triggers to external resources such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs. This can be useful for ensuring that your Azure Functions can only be triggered by authorized users or applications.

To use the `TriggerAuthentication` CRD, you first need to create a trigger authentication object. This can be done using the `kubectl create triggerauthentication` command. Once you have created the trigger authentication object, you can reference it in your Azure Function trigger configuration.

For example, the following Azure Function trigger configuration would authenticate the trigger to Azure Storage using a managed identity:

YAML

```
bindings:
  my-blob-input:
    type: blobTrigger
```

## Memo

Azure Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. Durable Functions functions can be chained together to create complex workflows, and they can be triggered by a variety of events, such as HTTP requests, Azure Storage events, and timer events.

Durable Functions functions are stateful, which means that they can maintain state between executions. This is possible because Durable Functions uses a durable storage mechanism, such as Azure Storage, to persist state data.

Durable Functions also provide a number of features that make them suitable for building long-running workflows, such as:

- **Checkpointing:** Durable Functions can checkpoint their state periodically, which allows them to resume execution from where they left off if they fail or timeout.
- **Restarting:** Durable Functions can be restarted from any checkpoint, which allows you to retry processing a workflow even if it fails.
- **Orchestration:** Durable Functions provides a number of features that make it easy to orchestrate the execution of multiple functions, such as conditional execution, fan-out/fan-in, and durable timers.

## Async pattern in Azure

The async pattern is a programming pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is code that can run without blocking the main thread of execution. This is useful for long-running tasks, such as processing blob data.

There are two ways to write asynchronous code in Azure Functions:

- **Async/await:** Async/await is a language feature that makes it easy to write asynchronous code in C# and other .NET languages.
- **Azure Async HTTP API pattern:** The Azure Async HTTP API pattern is a way to write asynchronous code in Azure Functions that does not require you to use async/await.

## Using Durable Functions and the async pattern to process blob data

To use Durable Functions and the async pattern to process blob data, you would:

1. Create a Durable Function function that performs the necessary processing.
2. Configure an output binding on the blob to trigger the Durable Function function.
3. Use the async/await pattern or the Azure Async HTTP API pattern to write the Durable Function function so that it can process the blob data asynchronously.

When the blob is uploaded to Azure Storage, the output binding will trigger the Durable Function function. The function will then begin processing the blob data. If the function takes longer than four minutes to process the data, it will checkpoint its state and then restart from that checkpoint.

This process will continue until the function has finished processing all of the data in the blob. Once the function has finished processing the data, it will complete successfully.

## Benefits of using Durable Functions and the async pattern to process blob data

There are a number of benefits to using Durable Functions and the async pattern to process blob data:

- **Reliability:** Durable Functions functions are reliable because they can checkpoint their state and restart from any checkpoint. This means that you can be confident that your blob data will be processed successfully even if the function fails or times out.
- **Scalability:** Durable Functions functions can scale horizontally, which means that you can handle large volumes of blob data without having to worry about performance bottlenecks.
- **Simplicity:** Durable Functions provides a number of features that make it easy to write asynchronous code and to orchestrate the execution of multiple functions. This means that you can focus on writing the code that processes your blob data, and you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Durable Functions and the async pattern are a powerful combination for processing blob data in Azure. By using Durable Functions, you can write reliable and scalable code that can handle large volumes of data. And by using the async pattern, you can write code that is efficient and easy to maintain.

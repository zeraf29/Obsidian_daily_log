## Memo



**Run command**

The Run command feature is a lightweight way to execute scripts on Azure VMs. It allows you to run simple PowerShell scripts or Bash commands directly from the Azure portal. The Run command feature is useful for quick troubleshooting tasks, such as restarting a service or checking a file's contents.

**Serial console**

The Serial console feature provides direct access to the console of an Azure VM. This allows you to view and interact with the VM's console output, even if the VM is not connected to the network. The Serial console feature is useful for debugging boot-related issues or diagnosing network connectivity problems.

**Hybrid runbook worker**

The Hybrid runbook worker is a lightweight agent that can be installed on-premises or in Azure VMs. It allows you to run Automation runbooks on these machines, which can be used to automate tasks such as patch management, configuration management, and incident response. The Hybrid runbook worker is useful for centralizing management of both on-premises and Azure resources.

**Custom script extension**

The Custom script extension is a powerful tool for automating tasks on Azure VMs. It allows you to run complex scripts, including PowerShell scripts, Bash commands, and Python scripts, on a VM. The Custom script extension is useful for tasks that require more flexibility than the Run command feature, such as installing software or configuring complex settings.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between these features:

|Feature|Description|Use cases|
|---|---|---|
|Run command|Lightweight way to execute scripts|Quick troubleshooting tasks|
|Serial console|Direct access to VM's console|Debugging boot-related issues or diagnosing network connectivity problems|
|Hybrid runbook worker|Run Automation runbooks on-premises or in Azure VMs|Centralized management of on-premises and Azure resources|
|Custom script extension|Run complex scripts on Azure VMs|Tasks that require more flexibility than the Run command feature|

## Memo



The terms "Azure VM features" and "Azure features" encompass different aspects of Azure's capabilities.

**Azure VM features** specifically refer to the functionalities and characteristics of Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), which are cloud-based compute resources that provide the same capabilities as traditional on-premises servers. These features include:

1. **Compute options:** Azure VMs offer a wide range of compute options to suit various workloads, from basic single-core VMs to high-performance multi-core VMs with specialized accelerators.
    
2. **Storage options:** Azure VMs can be provisioned with various storage options, including local SSDs, Azure Managed Disks, and Azure Blob Storage, offering flexible and scalable storage solutions.
    
3. **Networking options:** Azure VMs can be connected to various virtual networks, enabling secure and controlled communication between VMs and other Azure resources.
    
4. **Security features:** Azure VMs provide a range of security features, including access control mechanisms, encryption tools, and threat detection capabilities to protect against unauthorized access and threats.
    
5. **Management features:** Azure VMs can be managed and monitored using various tools, including the Azure portal, Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell, providing comprehensive management capabilities.
    

**Azure features**, on the other hand, encompass a broader range of functionalities and capabilities that extend beyond just Azure VMs. They include features that are applicable to various Azure services and platforms, such as:

1. **Core features:** These features provide the essential functionality of Azure services, enabling users to perform basic tasks and operations, such as creating and managing storage accounts, deploying web applications, or analyzing data.
    
2. **Advanced features:** These features offer more sophisticated capabilities beyond the core features, catering to specialized needs or complex use cases, such as advanced networking options, data analytics tools, or machine learning integrations.
    
3. **Management features:** These features provide tools and capabilities for managing, monitoring, and optimizing Azure resources and services, enabling users to track resource usage, identify potential issues, and implement configurations to enhance performance and security.
    
4. **Security features:** These features focus on protecting Azure resources and data from unauthorized access, threats, and vulnerabilities, including access control mechanisms, encryption tools, threat detection and mitigation capabilities.
    
5. **Integration features:** These features facilitate the connection and interoperability between Azure services and third-party applications or platforms, enabling users to integrate Azure with their existing infrastructure, tools, and workflows.
    
6. **Productivity features:** These features enhance the efficiency and productivity of developers and IT professionals working with Azure, including tools for code generation, debugging, testing, and deployment.
    
7. **Cost optimization features:** These features provide tools and insights to help users optimize their Azure spending and manage cloud costs effectively, enabling users to identify cost-saving opportunities, track resource utilization, and implement cost-effective configurations.
    
8. **Monitoring and alerting features:** These features enable users to monitor the health, performance, and usage of Azure resources and services, providing real-time insights, generating alerts for potential issues, and facilitating troubleshooting.
    
9. **Governance features:** These features provide tools and capabilities for implementing governance policies and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, enabling users to manage resource access, enforce security policies, and track resource usage.
    
10. **Automation features:** These features enable users to automate tasks, workflows, and processes within Azure, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency, including tools for creating custom scripts, running scheduled tasks, and automating deployments.

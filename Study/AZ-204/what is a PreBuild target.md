## Memo


A PreBuild target is a custom target defined in a project file (e.g., .csproj) that is executed before the actual build process starts. It allows you to perform tasks such as cleaning up temporary files, generating code, or running scripts before the build commences. This ensures that certain prerequisites are met or actions are taken before the main build process takes place.

**Benefits of using PreBuild targets:**

1. **Early preparation:** PreBuild targets allow you to perform tasks early in the build process, ensuring that necessary preparations or actions are completed before the actual build begins.
    
2. **Flexibility:** You can define multiple PreBuild targets to execute different tasks in a specific order. This provides flexibility in customizing the preparation steps before the main build.
    
3. **Enforcing dependencies:** PreBuild targets can be used to enforce dependencies between tasks. For instance, you can make the main build dependent on a PreBuild target that generates necessary code.
    
4. **Encapsulation:** PreBuild targets encapsulate specific tasks within the project file, keeping the build process organized and maintainable.
    

**Examples of PreBuild target usage:**

1. **Generating code:** You can use a PreBuild target to generate code from a template or perform code transformations before the actual compilation stage.
    
2. **Running scripts:** PreBuild targets can be used to execute scripts that perform tasks such as setting up environment variables, downloading dependencies, or cleaning up temporary files.
    
3. **Validating input files:** A PreBuild target could be used to validate input files before the build proceeds, ensuring that the build process starts with valid data.
    
4. **Generating documentation:** PreBuild targets can be used to generate documentation for the project before the build, ensuring that updated documentation is available along with the compiled code.
